INSIGHT 1: Patient-Trial Matching
=================================
  Agent A documented: John Doe has Acute Myocardial Infarction
                      and elevated Troponin-T

  Agent B documented: CARDIAC-2024 trial requires patients with
                      confirmed MI by Troponin-T biomarkers

  DISCOVERY: John Doe is an EXCELLENT candidate for CARDIAC-2024!
             (Neither agent knew about this match until now)

INSIGHT 2: Biomarker Sensitivity Discovery
==========================================
  Agent A observed: Multiple patients have Troponin-T elevation
                    independent of acute MI diagnosis

  Agent B found: High-sensitivity Troponin-T assay detects
                 cardiac stress in Chronic Kidney Disease

  DISCOVERY: Troponin-T may be sensitive indicator of subclinical
             cardiac stress in CKD patients!
             (This insight emerged from combining independent observations)

INSIGHT 3: Research Direction
=============================
  Agent A reported: Robert Martinez has history of CKD with
                    multiple MI events and elevated Troponin-T

  Agent B developed: BNP-HEART study tracking biomarkers in
                     heart failure with CKD comorbidity

  DISCOVERY: Robert Martinez could provide valuable data point
             for understanding Troponin-T kinetics in post-MI
             patients with renal dysfunction!

What Makes This Collaboration Powerful:

1. INDEPENDENCE: Each agent works in their own domain
   - Care Coordinator focuses on patient management
   - Lab Assistant focuses on research and biomarkers
   - Clinical Decision Agent focuses on synthesis
   - No explicit coordination required!

2. EMERGENT CONNECTIONS: Relationships appear without being defined
   - Agents never said "connect John Doe to CARDIAC-2024"
   - They just mentioned shared concepts (Troponin-T, MI, etc.)
   - The graph automatically revealed the connection!

3. SCALABILITY: System improves with more agents
   - 3 agents → some cross-domain insights
   - 10 agents → exponential discovery opportunities
   - 100 agents → powerful emergent intelligence

4. DISCOVERY WITHOUT ASKING: Insights surface organically
   - No need to run specific queries for connections
   - Agents can't miss relationships because they emerge naturally
   - Even unknown unknowns might be revealed!

The Real Magic: Agents don't need to know about each other.
They just document their knowledge using shared terminology
(wiki-links), and the graph handles the rest.
