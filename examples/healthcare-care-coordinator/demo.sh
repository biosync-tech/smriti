cat << 'EOF'

Based on the knowledge graph, the care coordinator has discovered:

1. PRIORITY CASE: James Mitchell (Age 67)
   Status: HIGH RISK - Multiple chronic conditions, new AFib alert
   Conditions: Atrial Fibrillation, Hypertension, Type 2 Diabetes
   Medications: Apixaban, Metoprolol, Metformin
   Recent Alert: Irregular heartbeat on smartwatch (Apple Watch)

   Action Items:
   ✓ Verify anticoagulation compliance (prevent stroke)
   ✓ Urgent cardiology referral (AFib management)
   ✓ Sleep optimization (currently 6.2 hrs vs target 7-9)
   ✓ BP monitoring (morning readings elevated)

2. STABLE CASE: Maria Gonzalez (Age 54)
   Status: STABLE - Well-controlled hypertension, stable kidney function
   Conditions: Hypertension, Stage 2 CKD
   Medications: Lisinopril, Amlodipine
   Status: All parameters within target range

KEY INSIGHTS FROM GRAPH ANALYSIS:
- Wiki-links create rapid navigation between related records
- Wearable alerts automatically surface urgent findings
- Risk assessments flag high-priority patients for triage
- Medication tracking prevents duplications and interactions
- Care plans centralize action items and follow-ups

CARE COORDINATOR EFFICIENCY GAIN:
Instead of manually checking multiple systems, the care coordinator
used Smriti to discover all connections in seconds, enabling:
  • Faster decision-making
  • Comprehensive patient view
  • Alert detection
  • Risk prioritization
  • Medication verification
